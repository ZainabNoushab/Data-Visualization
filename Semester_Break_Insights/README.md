# 📊 Semester Break Insights

This data visualization project captures 14 days of personal activity and wellness data — including sleep, prayer, Quran recitation, learning hours, mood, and English fluency practice — during my semester break.

Using **pandas** and **matplotlib**, I explored patterns through:

- 📈 Line chart: Learning hours over time  
- 📊 Bar chart: Namaz offered daily  
- 🥧 Pie chart: Proportion of time spent on different activities  
- 🌟 Scatter plot: Sleep hours vs mood rating  

All visualizations are stored in the `figures/` folder. This project reflects not only technical skills but also my commitment to self-improvement and consistent tracking.
